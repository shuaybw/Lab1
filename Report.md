# DA219B - Lab 1:
Lab 1 is a full-stack development assignment focused on creating a RESTful API with Express and Node.js, linked to a MongoDB database, and integrated with a front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal is to manage recipe data through CRUD operations. The lab involves individual work, culminating in a code submission and a presentation.

When I began working on the lab, I recalled a lecture where our teacher highlighted the use of MVCâ€”short for Model-View-Controller. It's a software architectural pattern that splits an application into three interconnected parts. This design facilitates managing complexity by enabling independent development, maintenance, and scalability of each component. With this structure, modifications can be made to one part of the application without impacting others, thereby enhancing the development process and the application's maintainability.

During the lab process, I didn't encounter any major issues, just some minor hiccups that weren't very significant. One issue I remember was having trouble connecting to MongoDB. It turned out that the problem was simply that I had forgotten to remove the "<>" symbols from the connection string.

I decided to use something called asynchandler which is a simple middleware for managing exceptions in asynchronous Express routes and forwarding them to your Express error handlers. This makes for simpler and clean code. 

In conclusion, developing Lab 1 gave me deep insights into full-stack web development and the integration of front-end and back-end components using the MVC architecture. This experience was invaluable for enhancing my skills in creating interactive web applications.
